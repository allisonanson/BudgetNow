2022/01/25 - Researched tech stacks and concluded I would use the MERN stack for my small project. I chose MERN because I already have experience with it, it is best suited for small scale applications, and everything is written in JavaScript so it is easier for me to understand. Also, JavaScript is best suited for the browser, which is where my application will reside.

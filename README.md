# BudgetNow
The BudgetNow app is a web app that allows users to budget and manage their money using the 6 Jars Budget (https://youtu.be/AE7yaIR1ndM).

I am working on this project using Agile processes. Here is the Trello board I set up for this project: **https://trello.com/b/iFzuqMnG**. 


Tech stack notes: 
- Front End is where the user interface is created. for browsers, JavaScript is common, for Mobile, iOS and Android are used. 
- Back End is where any server/cloud services are used (AWS), databases (MongoDB, MySQL), and server-side runtime environments like nodeJS or Python. 
- APIs are the glue. they can perform front end and back end actions (REST), and are usually essential to the app's function (Plaid). 

JavaScript for front end if using browser. 
React is good for simpler logic.
